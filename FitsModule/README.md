We don't know what we're doing and we don't know why we're doing it.

To make this code work, you'll need some datafiles. Get these from https://github.com/demitri/SciCoder-2018-Melbourne. I'm saving them in ./Datafiles/spectra. A list of all the files that are used is provided in source/fitsfiles.config. 

Other than than, I've tried to structure this as closely as the advice given to us on Presentation 5 - Slide 10. 

Things to do:

* Write tests
* Write classes
* Write a program that extracts the metadata of a HDU file and saves it in a specialised class.
* ...so really, everything except set up this GIT.

Also feel free to change anything and everything. It's GIT. We can always go back later.

It's been a tough season, but I think this team has what it takes to make it all the way to state. Let's get out there and make coach Demitri proud :')
